# Mini-Search

Java program to search articles culled from Wikipedia (1st paragraph only) using a key word or phrase.

Uses hash tables and a MaxHeap to calculate cosine similarity and print out top 3 hits.


To use:
* Put all the files in the same folder (and extract the articles folder)
* Compile and run MiniSearch.java



Feel free to let me know what you think, or to suggest improvements and/or ways to develop this further! Thanks!
